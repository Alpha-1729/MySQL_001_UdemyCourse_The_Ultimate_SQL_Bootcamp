-- Timestamps

/*
>>>> Timestamps vs DateTime
		They both store datetime information, but there's a difference in the range, 
		TIMESTAMP has a smaller range. TIMESTAMP also takes up less space. 
   		TIMESTAMP is used for things like meta-data about when something is created or updated.
>>>> The output of NOW() function is a TimeStamp.
