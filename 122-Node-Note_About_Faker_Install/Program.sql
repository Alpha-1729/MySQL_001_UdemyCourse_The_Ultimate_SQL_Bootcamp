>>>> Run this command in the terminal to install the package:
        npm install @faker-js/faker --save-dev
>>>> Enter this code in your file to require it:
        const { faker } = require('@faker-js/faker');
>>>> About Flaker:
        In the next lecture you'll learn about a tool called Faker that allows you to create fake placeholder data to use in your applications.
>>>> Create empty package.json file.
        npm init -y
>>>> Error fix:
        If your container name is mysql then running the npm init -y  command will automatically name your npm project mysql, also. This is problematic because a few lectures from now you will be installing the mysql npm package and it won't allow you to install that package to an npm project with the same name.
